## Introduction

This PHP SDK is an API wrapper that allows developers to integrate their PHP applications easily with Arcadier's APIs. It does the heavily lifting of building the requests and authentication for every API call

This lets you focus on **building your front-end** instead of having to worry about if you setup the backend properly with our APIs.

All you need to know is how to which parameters in each function. This is documenteted [here]().

## Requirements
* PHP 7.0.0+
* PHP Server
* An Arcadier marketplace of [package Scale](https://www.arcadier.com/packages.html) or above (including [Enterprise](https://www.arcadier.com/enterprise/))

## Installation via Composer
You can install SDK via composer using the following command line:
```php
composer require arcadier/arcadier-php
```

## ðŸ’¡ Getting Started
### Authenticating with you marketplace
Once the SDK is installed in your directory, navigate to `arcadier-php/src/.env` and edit the `.env` file by following the instructions in it.

Information you will be required to input:
* CLIENT_ID = ""
* CLIENT_SECRET = ""
* DOMAIN = ""
* PROTOCOL = ""

### Trying it
In every PHP script in your root directory, make sure to include `api.php`
```php
require "vendor\arcadier\arcadier-php\src\api.php";
$sdk = new ApiSdk();
```
Then you will be able to call Arcadier's APIs on your marketplace.

Get your marketplace's information

**GET** **```/api/v2/marketplaces```** is mapped to `$sdk->getMarketplaceInfo();`
```php
$marketplace_info = $sdk->getMarketplaceInfo();
echo $marketplace_info;
```

Listing all items:

**GET** **```/api/v2/items```** is mapped to `$sdk->getAllItems();`
```php
$item_list = $sdk->getAllItems();
echo $item_list['Records']; //The actual array of items is in the "Records" field of the JSON response
```

Searching for an item

**POST** **```/api/v2/items```** is mapped to `$sdk->searchItems();`
```php
$data = [
    'keywords' => 'string',
    'pagesize' => 'string',
    'Categories' =>[
        'string'
    ],
    'sellerID' => 'string'
];

$response = $sdk->searchItems($data);
$results = $response['Records']; //The actual array of matching items is in the "Records" field of the JSON response
```

## Example Projects
* **Basic e-commerce search page**
We have built simple website that searches and displays the items of an Arcadier marketplace. This website is hosted outside of Arcadier's servers but is connected to the marketplace via the SDK. Head over [here](https://github.com/Arcadier/sample-PHP-SDK-web-app) to find the source code.

* **Request For Quotation (RFQ) Plug-In**
This Plug-In serves as sample code to demonstrate the steps to create an RFQ experience on Arcadier's marketplaces. Head over [here]() to find the code.
